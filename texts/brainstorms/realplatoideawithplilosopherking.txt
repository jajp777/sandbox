The real idea behind Plato philosopher king is not about having kings or rulers that are philosopher. Do not get me wrong, that is what Plato thought would be the ideal. But the core of the idea that survived was not the philosopher king, but the "ideal king".

Every critic of plato idea would correct him stating that the "ideal king" would be a philosopher, but would be: a warrior, a prophet, a just and wise etc... So we can say that Plato starts the tradition of the search for the "ideal ruler". Off course that an era will state that the ideal ruler have the most prominient qualities of this era. A warrior era of a warrior culture will see the ideal ruler as the ideal warrior.

This will generate the idea of just and unjust ruler. If the ruler possess the "ideal qualities" he is a just ruler, if not, he is a unjust ruler. Thill will open the space for the ruler interpretation. At least one person (probably a group of people) will interpret that the ruler is the perfect exemplar of the "ideal qualities" and other group will interpret another ruler-wanna-be as the ideal ruler.

This will open space to conspiracy and revolucionary movements. That is anotehr reason why the communist movement is wrong. They thought that once economic classes were abolished, we would live in ethernal peace. Given that conspiracy CAN be created from  non-economic circuntances, communism will not eliminate politcal instability.

But conspiracy have existed before the "ideal ruler". But probably because the ruler-wanna-be wanted to hav access to all privilegies of the ruler.
