Realism in politics were the second biggest step in political theory. The first were of course with Plato and Aristotle.
This second step was done by Saint Augustine of Hippo were he put in perspective that politics can not ignore good and evil, a long search in Augustine life.
The subject were more or less lived through Machiavelli that change its meaning for being imoral or amoral. That generated its fruits in the Germany unification.
In my opinion we must study better and bring back Augustine POV. Good and Evil are intrinsical part of politics. But not as agents, that is the most important part, andone thing taht killed this perspective.
Good and Evil are spread in all agents, in differente levels, off course, but are represented in Actions. Maybe this was already represented in Helliod as the Gods had some influence in the happennings but they do not determine the final results.
Another of source is of course the New Testment where the Holy Spirit is the Good in Agent. Jesus is also the Good in agent.
The old testment, where God makes some very strange and doubtfull suggestions is not the Good Agent. It is very interesting to study and understand why theJews have not understood God as a complete Good Agent. I would say that until Jesus, they had not understood the promises as complete and were not completelly converted.
