The Portuguese victory against the Islamic invasors after 7 centuries of dominance was atotally unexpected and a notable history event. The Ceuta war and its complete massacre inflated the Portuguese ego.
But Portugal had serious problem to consume this facts, somehow it interpreted the victory as new covenant between God and the Portuguese people. Something similar to covenant between God and the jewish people. So Portugal started a christian revolutionary movement of the Sacrum Imperium.

So, somehow Portugal has regressed to a pre-Christian era of religion validity. The same validity that is the basis for Islam. In its second war, the first attemp to invade and dominate Mecca, the muslim army looses a war and they start to doubt Muhammed. This is the same framework that the fist jews used to validate its profets. 

"Is God going to prove to us that He is on our side giving us victory?"

The primitivism of a religion can be associated with the primitivism of the validation of its truthness. As any other science. In this sense we can categorise the religions as:
1 - Primitive religions: primitive proofs
2 - Probabilistic religions:  he must be a prophet because he has achieve something so unusual that God must be on his side.
3 - Experienced religions: I experienced the prophet doing something that transcend our power. He must be a prophet.
