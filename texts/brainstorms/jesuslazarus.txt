The bible is very clear in the sense that Ezequiel narrates the Lazarus scene as a proof that Jesus actually brought Lazarus abck to life. To doubt this narration cannot change his belief:

YOU ------[believe or not] -------> [Bible as we know]
                                            |
                                            |
                                    [some modification]
                                            |
                                            |
                                    ["original bible"] <-------------[ezequiel]

One cal doubt that what is narrated today was actually what ezequiel saw. Althought is probably impossible to know this today. We must separate theses two things.
