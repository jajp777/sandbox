Samuel 16:7 English Standard Version (ESV)
But the Lord said to Samuel,
Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him.
For the Lord sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart

In some way it was already on the bible, and in the Hebrew conscience the knowledge that man knows things only by its appeareance and only God  could know things by its essense, in Bible lingo represented as the "heart"
