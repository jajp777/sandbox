One of the most famous differences between Plato and Aristotle is represented by the famous paint The School of Athens from Raphael.

Plato starting in the individual, going to the species, has follow the conclusion that the perfection is in a more general level than the individual, arriving at the supreme good, God, as the supremum perfection.

Aristotle on the other side knew that the perfection of the individual is not a in a more general level, but is exactly the the species, including all its differences  to other species of the same genre.
