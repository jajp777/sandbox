Archetypical thinking can be, in the Jung meaning, the expantion of a character or history so it is somehow at the limit of its meaning. Jesus is the archetypical history of injustice and suffering (tyranical government, injust trial, religious persecution, treason, abandonishment of its disciples etc...). It is hard to find another dimension that can be streched. So is a sense, a archetypical history is a history in its madure form.

The same intension can be found in Socrates. Socrates has three phases: first, Socrates tries to uncover the real meaning behind words, second Socrates tries to uncover, sarcastically, that some "wise mans" actually know nothing, and in the third phase, Socrates tries to mature an idea to its "perfection". And only in its perfection the idea participates in the dialectic process.

"Quem quiser ser vitorioso no reino da pesquisa cientifica tem de deixar o adversário aparecer com todo o seu armamento e força."

Então nesse processo, temos o amadurecimento dos 4 discursos:
Poetics: Archetypical thinking/maturing
Rethorics: Aristotle rhetoric works??
Dialectic: Socratic/Platonic maturing of ideas
Logic: Mathematical reasoning and advancements??
