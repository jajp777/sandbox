A good experiement would be to model economy as a vector field and important points:
1 - farms
2 - industries
3 - shops
4 - banks
5 - governments
6 - houses

modeleds as areas in a vector fields and understand each role in the economy using divergence theory.

A profit company would be a divergent area in utility.
Farms would also be divergent in utility, but also materially.
House would be convergent but they consume more than they produce.

We would have two dual fields.
One mapping the flow of utility. One mapping the flow of cash/money.

This explain the so called accumulation of richness. It is just one side of the "coin".
