There are various ways to measure richness:
1 - Local currency comparison;
2 - Global currency comparison;
3 - Normalized currency comparison;
4 - Globalized product comparison;
5 - Hours of work comparison

But I still have not found a framework to compare wealth by the capacity of inserting a acquisiton in a healthy way in a agent budget.

So in this framework the richer is not the one that has a big number in its paycheck, not the time spent to buy something, but the hability to healthy acquire something.

In this way, the unhealthy expansion of credit is not a process to enrich a population, we all know how artificial cost of capital can deform all capital calculation (see ABCT).
