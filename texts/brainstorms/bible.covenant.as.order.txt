It is very hard to recover the meaning between the covenant between the hebrew people and God. Interpretations abudant:

//TODO put reference
1 - The racism interpretation

The Hebrew is the chosen race

2 - The political interpretation

The Hebrew city/kingdom is the chosen city/kingdom for some reason.

3 - The cultural interpretation

The Hebrew culture is the chosen because it is the better/stronger/more advanced.

I started to think what if the covenant it is not a God sent covenant, but a Hebrew request to prosper. "We need a covenant that the present order will not change because we will make sacrifices to live a propster life in the future".

This can be linked in the Austrian Business Cycle Theory because in the government when it artifically lower the yeild it is creating a unsustainable reality. Every investiment uses the new Cost of Capital to analyse its return. Every investment is making a covenant with the government, do not change the cost of money or we are all going to fail together.

Given that the reality is not sustainable, the government is going to need to change the reality and a percentage of those investiment are not going to be profitable in the new reality.

This can be generalized by a GFT, Generalized Failed Theory, that explains failure in changing environemnts, that will somehow unify the ABCT with the Darwin expectations os Natural Selection.

So, the Hebrew Covenant was a the Hebrew perception that is impossible to build a Civilization, based on Sacrifice, with changing rules. Order, a God covenant, is necessary.
