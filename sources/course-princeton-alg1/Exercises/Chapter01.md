It is the Fibonacci sequence

## 1.1.7 Give the value printed by each of the following code fragments:

1.

    double t = 9.0;
    while (Math.abs(t - 9.0/t) > .001)
        t = (9.0/t + t) / 2.0;
    StdOut.printf("%.5f\n", t);

2.

    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < 1000; i++)
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++)
            sum++;
    StdOut.println(sum);

3.

    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < 1000; i *= 2)
        for (int j = 0; j < 1000; j++)
            sum++;
    StdOut.println(sum);

### Answers

1.

Aproximation of the squared root of 9.
3.00009

2.

Sum of the arithmetic progression starting between 1 and 999
999(1+999)/2 = 499,500

3.

log_2 {1000} = (log 1000) / (log 2)  
             = 3 / 0.30102999566398119521373889472449  
             = 9.9657842846620870436109582884683  
             = 9 <- Max integer power lower than 1000  

Starting in zero and finishing in 9, we have  
= (9-0)+1  
= 9+1  
= 10 items  

Just to be sure

0 1 2 3 4  5  6  7   8   9  
1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512  

OK!

So the algorithm will print the sum:

= 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + ... + 1000 <10 times>  
= 1000 * 10  
= 10,000  

## 1.1.8 What do each of the following print?
1. System.out.println('b');
2. System.out.println('b' + 'c');
3. System.out.println((char) ('a' + 4));
Explain each outcome.

###Answers
1. b
2. 197
3. 'a' = 61
61 + 4 = 65 = 'e'
so
e

## 1.1.9 Write a code fragment that puts the binary representation of a positive integer N into a String s .
Solution: Java has a built-in method Integer.toBinaryString(N) 
for this job, but the point of the exercise is to see how
such a method might be implemented. Here is a particularly
concise solution:

    String s = "";
    for (int n = N; n > 0; n /= 2)
    s = (n % 2) + s;

### Answers

    int x = 7;
    uint mask = (uint)1 << 31;
    while(mask > 0)
    {
        var r = x & mask;
        Console.Write(r > 0 ? "1" : "0");
        mask = mask >> 1;
    }

## 1.1.10 What is wrong with the following code fragment?

    int[] a;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        a[i] = i * i;

Solution: It does not allocate memory for a[] with new.
This code results in a variable a might not have been
initialized compile-time error.

## 1.1.11 Write a code fragment that prints the contents of a two-dimensional boolean array, using * to represent true and a space to represent false . Include row and column numbers.

                Console.Write(" ".PadRight(lchars + 2));
            }

            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }

            i++;
        }

        return i;
    }

## 1.1.15 Write a static method histogram() that takes an array a[] of int values and an integer M as arguments and returns an array of length M whose i th entry is the number of times the integer i appeared in the argument array. If the values in a[] are all between 0 and Mâ€“1 , the sum of the values in the returned array should be equal to a.length.

### Asnwers

    private int[] Histogram(int size, int[] numbers)
    {
        var hist = new int[size];

        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.Length; i++)

## 1.1.16 Give the value of exR1(6) :

    public static String exR1(int n)
    {
        if (n <= 0) return "";
        return exR1(n-3) + n + exR1(n-2) + n;
    }

### Answers

exR1(6) = exR1(3) + 6 + exR1(4) + 6
        = (exR1(0) + 3 + exR1(1) + 3) 
            + 6 
            + (exR1(1) + 4 + exR1(2) + 4)

        = ("" + 3 + (exR1(-2) + 1 + exR1(-1) + 1) + 3)
            + 6
            + (exR1(1) + 4 + exR1(2) + 4)

## 1.1.17 Criticize the following recursive function:
    
    public static String exR2(int n)
    {
        String s = exR2(n-3) + n + exR2(n-2) + n;
        if (n <= 0) return "";
        return s;
    }

Answer : The base case will never be reached. A call to exR2(3) will result in calls to exR2(0) , exR2(-3) , exR3(-6) , and so forth until a StackOverflowError occurs.

### Answers

The base case return must always be before the recursion call.

## 1.1.18 Consider the following recursive function:

    public static int mystery(int a, int b)
    {
        if (b == 0) return 0;
        if (b % 2 == 0) return mystery(a+a, b/2);
        return mystery(a+a, b/2) + a;
    }

What are the values of mystery(2, 25) and mystery(3, 11)?  
Given positive integers a and b , describe what value mystery(a, b) computes. Answer the same question, but replace the three + operators with * and replace return 0 with return 1 .

### Answers

mystery(2,25) = 50
mystery(3,11) = 33

It is the multiplication operator!

Changing it we got

mystery2(2,4) = 16

It is the power operator!

return F(N-1) + F(N-2);
}
public static void main(String[] args)
{
for (int N = 0; N < 100; N++)
StdOut.println(N + " " + F(N));

the value of F(N) ? Develop a better implementation of F(N) that saves computed values
in an array.
1.1.20 Write a recursive static method that computes the value of ln (N !).
1.1.21 Write a program that reads in lines from standard input with each line contain-
ing a name and two integers and then uses printf() to print a table with a column of
the names, the integers, and the result of dividing the first by the second, accurate to
three decimal places. You could use a program like this to tabulate batting averages for
baseball players or grades for students.
1.1.22 Write a version of BinarySearch that uses the recursive rank() given on page
25 and traces the method calls. Each time the recursive method is called, print the argu-
ment values lo and hi , indented by the depth of the recursion. Hint: Add an argument
to the recursive method that keeps track of the depth.
1.1.23 Add to the BinarySearch test client the ability to respond to a second argu-
ment: + to print numbers from standard input that are not in the whitelist, - to print
numbers that are in the whitelist.
1.1.24 Give the sequence of values of p and q that are computed when Euclidâ€™s algo-
rithm is used to compute the greatest common divisor of 105 and 24. Extend the code
given on page 4 to develop a program Euclid that takes two integers from the command
line and computes their greatest common divisor, printing out the two arguments for
each call on the recursive method. Use your program to compute the greatest common
divisor of 1111111 and 1234567.
1.1.25 Use mathematical induction to prove that Euclidâ€™s algorithm computes the
greatest common divisor of any pair of nonnegative integers p and q.

1.1.26 Sorting three numbers. Suppose that the variables a , b , c , and t are all of the
same numeric primitive type. Show that the following code puts a , b , and c in ascending
order:
if (a > b) { t = a; a = b; b = t; }

1.1.27 Binomial distribution. Estimate the number of recursive calls that would be
used by the code
public static double binomial(int N, int k, double p)
{
if ((N == 0) && (k == 0)) return 1.0;
if ((N < 0) || (k < 0)) return 0.0;
return (1 - p)*binomial(N-1, k, p) + p*binomial(N-1, k-1, p);
}
to compute binomial(100, 50, 0.25) . Develop a better implementation that is based
on saving computed values in an array.
1.1.28 Remove duplicates. Modify the test client in BinarySearch to remove any du-
plicate keys in the whitelist after the sort.
1.1.29 Equal keys. Add to BinarySearch a static method rank() that takes a key and
a sorted array of int values (some of which may be equal) as arguments and returns the
number of elements that are smaller than the key and a similar method count() that
returns the number of elements equal to the key. Note : If i and j are the values returned
by rank(key, a) and count(key, a) respectively, then a[i..i+j-1 ] are the values in
the array that are equal to key .
1.1.30 Array exercise. Write a code fragment that creates an N-by-N boolean array
a[][] such that a[i][j] is true if i and j are relatively prime (have no common fac-
tors), and false otherwise.
1.1.31 Random connections. Write a program that takes as command-line arguments

static double[][] mult(double[][] a, double[][] b) matrix-matrix product
static double[][] transpose(double[][] a) transpose
static double[] mult(double[][] a, double[] x) matrix-vector product
static double[] mult(double[] y, double[][] a) vector-matrix product

1.1.34 Filtering. Which of the following require saving all the values from standard
input (in an array, say), and which could be implemented as a filter using only a fixed
number of variables and arrays of fixed size (not dependent on N)? For each, the input
comes from standard input and consists of N real numbers between 0 and 1.

1.1.35 Dice simulation. The following code computes the exact probability distribu-
tion for the sum of two dice:
int SIDES = 6;
double[] dist = new double[2*SIDES+1];
for (int i = 1; i <= SIDES; i++)
for (int j = 1; j <= SIDES; j++)
dist[i+j] += 1.0;
for (int k = 2; k <= 2*SIDES; k++)
dist[k] /= 36.0;
The value dist[k] is the probability that the dice sum to k . Run experiments to vali-
date this calculation simulating N dice throws, keeping track of the frequencies of oc-
currence of each value when you compute the sum of two random integers between 1
and 6. How large does N have to be before your empirical results match the exact results
to three decimal places?
1.1.36 Empirical shuffle check. Run computational experiments to check that our
shuffling code on page 32 works as advertised. Write a program ShuffleTest that
takes command-line arguments M and N, does N shuffles of an array of size M that is
initialized with a[i] = i before each shuffle, and prints an M-by-M table such that row
i gives the number of times i wound up in position j for all j . All entries in the table
should be close to N/M.
1.1.37 Bad shuffling. Suppose that you choose a random integer between 0 and N-1
in our shuffling code instead of one between i and N-1 . Show that the resulting order is
not equally likely to be one of the N ! possibilities. Run the test of the previous exercise
for this version.
1.1.38 Binary search versus brute-force search. Write a program BruteForceSearch

1.1.39 Random matches. Write a BinarySearch client that takes an int value T as
command-line argument and runs T trials of the following experiment for N = 10 3 , 10 4 ,
10 5 , and 10 6 : generate two arrays of N randomly generated positive six-digit int values,
and find the number of values that appear in both arrays. Print a table giving the average
value of this quantity over the T trials for each value of N.
