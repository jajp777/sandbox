This movie took somewhere like dream I didn't care where. I never forget curtain blowing breeze. I still remember way made tilt head. I remember facial expression I saw it. I didn't know happened movie over, I find life way. It didn't bother me. The unfairness ultimate rejection innocent character strikes sadly real. I loved faces, way camera dwelt upon them. The camera gazed set unfocused eyes daydreamer. Borderline real way movies aren't. It exactly lack explanation, color, sharpness made enter consciousness like thief night. I love movie. Someday I it."2,Let say GRANNY extremely well made horror violence sure suspense moves!!!!!! best indie horror movie I ever seen 58 minutes long...It 5 20 favorite movie time. You people love this.
